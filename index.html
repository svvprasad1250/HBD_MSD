        <p>Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
            You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
            You can beat the world, you can win the war
            You can talk to God, go banging on his door
            You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock
            You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
            Some will call that practice, some will call that luck
            But either way you're going to the history books
            Standing in the Hall of Fame
            'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
            And the world's gonna know your name
            And the world's gonna know your name
            And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame.
            You can go the distance, you can run a mile
            You can walk straight through hell with a smile
            You can be a hero, you can get the gold
            Breaking all the records they thought would never be broke
            Yeah, do it for your people, do it for your pride
            Are you ever gonna know if you never even try?
            Do it for your country, do it for your name
            'Cause there's gonna be a day when you're
            Standing in the Hall of Fame
            And the world's gonna know your name
            'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
            And the world's gonna know your name
            And you'll be on the walls of the Hall of Fame.
